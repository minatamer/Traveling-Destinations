# Travelling Destinations - Website

<u>IMPORTANT:</u> The link attched to the repositry does not fully function as the database linked to the functionality of the website only worked locally. However, any user can still checkout the website using username and password: admin

This is a simple Academic project that focuses on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be able to pick up the basics of any websites such as logging in, signing up, buttons that redirect to other pages, embedding videos, putting pictures & text, etc.. 

This project's main focus however was to use a local database "MONGODB" and figure out how to store usernames and passwords of registered users. 

This website's idea is that, after a user signs up and logs on to their account, they are able to find out information about must-visit places around the world, with a photo and a 4k video (embedded from youtube) that would show the user a teaser of the place to get them intrigued. 

If the user likes this location, they can add it to their wishlist and this wishlist is stored on the local database and whenever they log in again the list stays the way it was.

A search functionality was also implemented to learn the basic idea of searching for something, whether by its full location name (such as "Paris
" for example) or with a substring (such as "Pa" and Paris should pop up as a result along side another location with the substring Pa).
